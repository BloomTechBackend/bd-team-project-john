# [John Team] Reflection

## Design

* I follow it 4/5 because I have not been 
* able to render a JSON object corresponding 
* to the error because Spring boot kind of take care of it to me. 

## Project

* * How did you handle the ambiguity of defining your own project and user
  stories? What strategies did you use to decide on concrete work to do to
  satisfy your requirements?
* I try in my mind to reproduce the MLP and try to stick on it for a debut.
* * How did you deal with getting stuck on a problem? What strategies did you
  employ to get yourself unblocked?
* I actually uses the 1:1 session with the instructor and also get some help form the IA Barry and some stuffs from internet
* Did any of your commitments you made in your team charter help navigate a
  difficult decision, situation, or collaboration challenge? How?
* Yes: I made me stick on the plan. Like "no matter what", I got to do it. 

## Scrum

* What did you find to be the most valuable part of daily stand-ups? Is there
  anything you would want to do differently at stand-up to make it more useful
  to you?
* N/A
* Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints?
  What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time?
* I Accurately estimate my works.

## Looking ahead

* If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently? How
  do you see yourself applying that to your work in later units, the capstone,
  or your internship?
My work give me a larger view of what an application really is and will definitely help me at works. 
* If I have to do it differently I would have used a lambda function instead of the Spring framework
